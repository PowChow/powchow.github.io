Just as baby name articles are mandatory reading for soon to be parents, the U.S. Social Security’s (SSA’s) Baby Names dataset should be required for budding data scientists. The dataset can be sliced and diced in many different ways, including language, time-based methods, and fodder for creative questions. It’s a healthy frequency based dataset with a very long timeline. For example, website analytics tools counts the number of visits by unique users, retail point of sale systems count products sold by color, and banks track the number of loans defaulted in a month. This article is a feature engineering tutorial on frequency data set. The goal of feature engineering is to distill characteristics of each name and then find relationships between name trends over time using peak analysis techniques. 

Example of the outcomes for names:

I started exploring names to find options. As a starting point, I assumed that trends over-time captured inherent qualities and societal attitudes of parents choosing certain names. Baby name trends are able to explain a lot about societal preferences, see Cross-Correlations of Baby Names [NCBI Article](). Also, when you know someone’s name then you likely know that person’s age, see *How to Tell Someone’s Name When all you Know Is Her Name*, [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/).

My own self-ish question about names: What U.S. names are most similar to my own old-timey name, Pauline?

See steps I took in the original article was published on [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/optimize-data-science-models-with-feature-engineering-cluster-analysis-metrics-development-and-4be15489667a) and code on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/paulinechow/baby-names-optimize-w-feature-engineering).

A summary of the key points below, relating to **feature engineering**, **cluster analysis**, and **metrics development**.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance. Techniques include:

- **Creating new variables**: Deriving new features from existing data to capture additional information.
- **Transforming variables**: Applying mathematical transformations to variables to meet model assumptions.
- **Handling missing values**: Implementing strategies to manage or impute missing data.

These steps ensure that models have access to the most relevant information, leading to better predictive accuracy.

## Cluster Analysis

Cluster analysis groups similar data points, aiding in the discovery of inherent structures within the data. Common methods are:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a multilevel hierarchy of clusters through agglomerative or divisive approaches.

By identifying these groupings, data scientists can tailor models to specific segments, enhancing overall performance.

## Metrics Development

Developing appropriate metrics is crucial for evaluating model effectiveness. Key considerations include:

- **Precision and Recall**: Balancing the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **F1 Score**: Combining precision and recall into a single metric.
- **ROC-AUC**: Assessing the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.

Selecting the right metrics ensures that models are evaluated comprehensively, leading to more reliable outcomes.

By integrating feature engineering, cluster analysis, and robust metrics development, data scientists can significantly optimize model performance and derive more accurate insights from data.
