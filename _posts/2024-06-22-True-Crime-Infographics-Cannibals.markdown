<p>I love stories. I picked up my first horror book at the public library—*The Fear Street* series by R.L. Stine. Writing and reading fiction helps me process ideas I encounter in the world, like the terrible mainstream news and horrible people I hear about. More so than watching, creating a story helps me understand. I think this is why I like working with data. Getting into the nitty-gritty, fine-tuning the facts, and drilling down below the surface are meditative.</p>

<p>A YouGov poll found that 61% of women consume true crime content, compared to 52% of men. 
*The New York Times* notes that some audiences of true crime shows (e.g., podcasts) are up to 80% women.
There is a safety in "knowing." Documentaries about serial killers are like tutorials on how to spot bad behaviors. 
Even though they don’t provide a definitive hack for identifying a predator or someone who might want to boil your bones in soup, they offer a sense of preparedness. 
I recently watched the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7293016/" target="_blank">Laci Peterson documentary</a>, which painted her husband as a sociopath who didn’t provide clear clues about her eventual demise. 
Similarly, *Longlegs*, a horror movie, doesn’t provide the origin story of the strange puppeteer stealing children’s and their families' souls.</p>

<p>All these ideas led me to search for crime datasets. I found one on Kaggle about cannibalistic homicides from 1903 to 2019. 
The dataset contains 121 cannibals and their 631 victims, collected by <a href="http://www.canibalismresearch.org" target="_blank">www.canibalismresearch.org</a>. This infographic is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The girlies who listen to true crime podcasts before bed.</li>
  <li>Writers of horror, thrillers, and murder mysteries. Your stories complete me.</li>
</ul>
