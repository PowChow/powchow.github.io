## Celebration and Jubilations 
Excited to launch this tech version of the blog. My first blog was about yoga, in which I learned Joomla and set it up on a weekend. Then I transitioned my efforts to wordpress out of a little laziness 

Setting up a new digital space feels like opening up a new toy or present. I convinced myself to make the transition from wordpress, paid hosting service, to jekyll through github pages, which is free, if you don't count my time figuring it out. This "tech debt" was a heavy guilt. In the two years that I started this blog, I hope to enhance and add content to current posts, even muster technical upgrades. One more year left in my OMSCS Computer Science Masters, while working full time as a business intelligence engineer. I couldn't ask for a better situation.

A search will yield a lot of resources for transitioning from a blogging tool to Jekyll. I listed the resources I used below, also as a shout out to awesome content and authors:

* How to save your comments? <a href="http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/" style="color:blue">Disqus integration</a>
* How to migrate content, posts and images? <a href="http://www.adamwadeharris.com/how-to-convert-a-wordpress-site-to-jekyll-with-github-pages/" style="color:blue">export wordpress.xml and convert to jekyll files</a> on your local machine 
* How to set up website? Starting with Jekyll and Github Pages:

* After understanding the above resources, find and download a template from the interwebs 

_From the archive November 2014_: Opening new writing space to encourage my own curiosity with data, publish insights on open data sets by public agencies, and document my learnings in computer science. I enrolled in one of Georgia Institute of Technology’s (GeorgiaTech’s) early online masters in computer science degree program and plan to specialize in machine learning. Feedback and insights are much appreciated here.</p>
